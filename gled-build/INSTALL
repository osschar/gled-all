INSTALL - Gled Build
====================

This is just a short overview. See http://www.gled.org/ for details.
In particular http://www.gled.org/docs/html/gledimp.html.

Tested platforms
----------------

Gled has been compiled on following platforms:
     i386-linux     RedHat 7.2, 7.3             (gcc 2.96)
		    RedHat 8.0, 9, debian sarge (gcc 3.2)
     alpha-linux    RedHat 7.2                  (gcc 2.96)


External software
-----------------

For base instalation the following packages are needed:

 ROOT    5.22                             (see http://root.cern.ch/)
 FLTK    1.1.9 with thread support        (see http://www.fltk.org/)
 fltk-mt 2.1                              (see http://www.gled.org/download/)
 DevIL   1.7.4	                          (see: http://www.imagelib.org/)

Other libsets might need additional libraries.

Build procedure
---------------

Set the environment for ROOT and GLED (this assumes (ba)sh), e.g.

export ROOTSYS=<dir-to-ROOT-installation>
export GLEDSYS=<in-principle-this-directory>
export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin:$GLEDSYS/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib:$GLEDSYS/lib
# fltk, fltk-mt and DevIL libraries must be available for base build

mkenv script for (ba)sh is provided. Run it as:

. `./mkenv <path-to-ROOT-installation>` [ Note the backticks! ]

or as

mkenv <path-to-ROOT-installation>

In the latter case it will return the name of file (in /tmp directory)
that contains the environment settings. You can copy/rename it and
store it somewhere. Still, you should source (or .) it.


Then, in principle, do:

1) check/edit defaults in configure.rc, or use command-line options.
   Options can be given as --<opt1>=<val1> or -<opt1> <val1>, option
   names can be abbreviated.
   The most relevant options are:
      -ucpp <str>    user cpp-flags (e.g. -D_SOMETHING_)
      -ucxx <str>    user cxx-flags
      -uld  <str>    user ld-flags
      -debug         implies -DDEBUG and -g (otherwise -O)
      -external      ':' separated list of directories to include/link from;
                     each <dir> implies -I<dir>/include and -L<dir>/lib
      -libsets       ':' separated dir list or
                     <auto>, <auto-prompt> selects all capitalized dirs or
                     <file:[filename]> a file with one libset per line

   Run: ./configure <whatever options you need>

   configure creates a file ./build_config. It containes perl-dump of
   two hashes holding information needed for compilation of libsets.
   Dependencies are resolved, so the order of compilation is
   determined properly even if build_libsets file contains them in a
   wrong order.

   Further, configure creates all auto-generated files and runs
   make depend in all lib-set directories. If you add your own classes
   make sure to:
   1) if you added a Gled-class, edit glass.list in appropriate lib-set
   2) run configure
      configure -reconfig will do for changes that don't change CPP,
      CXX or LD flags or external directories.
      Some of those can be hacked in the build_config file.
      --reconf is enough if you just want to add/remove some libsets
      to/from build.

3) Run: make

   The default target builds all libraries and executables and
   installs them into $GLEDSYS/lib and bin directories.

   Make process uses the default compiler. Export CXX variable if you
   want to use other compiler.


Basing a build on existing builds
---------------------------------

Another possibility is that you only want to build a few
dependant libsets and re-use already built ones. In this case you must
specify the existing build directories by passing the -base option:

./configure -base <dir1>:<dir2> <other-options>

"configure" then tries to resolve the dependencies from that
directories, symlinks them into the local directory and
installs all stuff needed for building into the local directory.


Getting additional libsets
--------------------------

Sources are available from SVN:

  https://svn.gled.org/gled/trunk/libsets/

Run ./configure. If you have an existing build, ./configure --reconf
will do (optionally listing the libsets, if auto-determination is
switched off).

If additional external software is installed in a non standard location
(given to previous full configure), hand-hack the build_config ... or
rebuild from scratch:

 ./make distclean
 ./configure `cat config.status` --ext=<old-path>:<new-location>
 ./make

Remember to also set PATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or /etc/ld.conf.so) in
your execution environment.


Getting sources of external packages
------------------------------------

For most external packages the source packages are also available
from:

  ftp://ftp.gled.org/cache/

This is for completeness only. If you intend to use/compile those
packages it is still a good idea to visit homepages of given projets.
