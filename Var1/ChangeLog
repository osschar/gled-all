	* Opcode/OPC_VolumeCollider.cpp:
	Hacked OPCODE to compile on 64-bits; not very pretty.  Introduced
	uxword typedef in IceTypes (unsigned long) to make enoug space for
	pointer/index representation. Not cool ... need to introduce a
	smart memory allocator (preemptive allocation with refit after the
	tree is built) for nodes/boxes and use indices as it was done
	before. But then there is the wole dirty bussines with
	bit-shifting of values and using the lsb to tag a node as used.
	Not something that can be done in one-day (well ... done yes,
	thought through no).

	Initial import from OPCODE-1.3. I did quite some reformatting
	(most of it automatic) to eliminate most of the 300+ character
	lines abundantly filled with tabs. Also removed a lot of redundant
	inlines while browsing through the code and trying to understand
	the structure. I started doing this sometime late in August.
