=head1 External software, build and portability


=head2 Build on freebsd, macosx, windows

=head3 Major issues

=over enum

=item \gled uses posix-threads. Make sure windows version is ok.

=item Build relies heavily on GNUmake and perl - use cygwin to build.

=item Makefiles are written for gcc - generalize that.

=item need portable hash_map and hash_set, both with multi variants.

=item \gled opens another X display and lets root run its own
one. Each run in separate thread and things mostly work. One needs to
lock root display when opening root windows from fltk.

On mac root uses X11 and fltk uses quartz (I managed to compile fltk
with X on mac and \gled somewhat worked).

On windows root uses gdk. I have no clue what this means for parallel
running of fltk.

=head2 Reconsider usage of DevIL as image library

DevIL is not thread safe. Someone should investigate this.

=head3 Tasks

=over enum

=item Make DevIL thread-safe by using TLD. Either use posix-threads or
implement separate solution for windows.

=item Evaluate ROOT's after-step image library. My major complain
against it was that it stores image internally as a set of float
arrays and copies them to byte-formats on demand. Check if this is
still so and if there is a reasonable way to bypass this. Is it
thread-safe?

=item Evaluate other options (also g3d). Consider portability and
thread-safety.

=item Move image library into GledCore. Use it for screen dumping.

=item Use GL functions for image rescaling. While at it, optionally
generate mipmaps in ZImage_GL_Rnr.

=head1 Central \gled


=head2 Do not stream rays.

Store in ray:

a) Raw array of Eye*s to which it was delivered. Each Eye sets its
value to zero.
   
b) Pointer to next/prev ray (global).

c) Add a mutex for access to I<custom buffer>.

Thus we can cleanup the mess if some Eye goes banana.

Eyes should connect to each queen individually. Then, queens can send
rays only to eyes that observe them.

=head2 class/libset ids.

better management of those

what about method ids?

=head2 lens ids

 make each king (queen?) an independent object space.

=head2 should we use namespaces for libsets?

class-naming consistency. now we have a mess (well, I have a mess).

=head2 Object instantiation.

Especially for glasses and stones.

Check what root does lately with operator new for TObject.

Check Hoard.

=head1 Minor annoyances


text rendering - try to use ftgl from root
