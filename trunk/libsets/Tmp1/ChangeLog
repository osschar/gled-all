	Several improvements in iso-surface generation.

	* Glasses/TabletStrokeList.cxx:
	* Glasses/TabletStrokeList.h:
	Implement full set of parameters for controling generation of
	iso-surface from a set of strokes.
	Implement two new algorithms for calculating potential at given
	point:
	- StrongestPoint: trivial, takes the strongest point;
	- LinearInterpolation: interpolates point parameters between two
	  closest / strongest points and recalculates the potential for this
	  point.
	Properly calculate search radius passed into KD-tree.
