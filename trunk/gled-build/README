README - Gled Build
===================

Gled is a framework for sharing object collections in a hierarchic
server-client model.

Gled is realeased under GNU GPL version 2. See LICENSE.

For building and installation instructions see INSTALL.

A brief description of files in this directory is in file MANIFEST.

This is a top-level Gled directory. It serves as a container for
libsets (in principle large compilation units) and provides:

 a) a compilation environment (in terms of parsers and code generators)

 b) run-time environment (by installing libraries, binaries or
    perl-scripts from local libsets into appropriate locations).

Libset names are typically capitalized as "This" or GledCore or Geom1.
The actual implementation of core Gled system is in the GledCore libset,
which contains two executables:
 * gled    standard executable with gui,
 * saturn  command interface only; useful for pure servers and proxies.

For a trivial demo type:

gled hello_gled.C

To navigate in GL window (pupil) use left/middle mouse buttons. Control key
modifies behaviour and is really usefull. <Home> will return you to the origin.

To connect to an already running gled, use:

gled -r -m <host-to-connect-to> moon.C
