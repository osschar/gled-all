Extracted from running setup at UCSD.

Missing:
- generalization for prefix (/opt/gled/ assumed in init.d/gled)
- install script (that also replaces the prefix)
- creation of gled user
- creation of /var/run/gled/ and /var/log/gled/ directories

This ishould also be a good base for rpm building stuff.
