\textbf{\gled is} a \cxx framework/toolkit, heavily based on
\root, and having much the same flavour

\begin{enumerate}
\item distributed computing (hierarchical server-client model)%
  \hfill {\large really too early to say more}

\item management of object collections and object-interaction (w/GUI)%
  \hfill {\large (1) $\to$ collaborative tools}

\item dynamic 3D visualization (OpenGL)%
  \hfill {\large (1\&2) $\to$ multiplayer online game engine}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{History:} proto-implementation 1998 (not much of the code left)\nl
used it in 2000 for analysis, simulation and visualiztion of a
test-beam set-up\nl
since mid 2001 working on it $\sim 70\%$

first public release \texttt{gled-1.2.0} in June 2003\nl
1.2.3 released this June

altogether $\sim4.5$\;work-years; (S)F support provided by J. Javor\v{s}ek

last half year actually being used for steering and visualization of
\texttt{Pythia6} extended with user-processes

\bigskip

\textbf{Availability:} \texttt{GNU/Linux}, but no general reason
against portability\hfill \textbf{License:} GPL-2.0

% ROOT as a base framework

\textbf{\LARGE \root, from the perspective of \gled, has:} 

\bigskip
\textbf{Versatile object serialization methods and
  accompanying services}\nl
%
inner file structure w/versioning: \texttt{TFile \& TDirectory}\nl
%
\texttt{rootd}: such service absolutely necessary for a distributed
system\nl
%
object aggregation methods: \texttt{C}-pointers, \texttt{TRef} and
\texttt{TCollection}\nl
%
\hs6 (in fact \gled also uses some of its own; but \root offers a very
clean data model)

\bigskip
\textbf{Good (and portable) OS interface}\qq (would need some
modularization in appl. start-up \& event handling)\nl
networking \dots\ in future use also authentication and (optionally)
\texttt{TSecureSocket}\nl
thread abstraction layer (khm \dots\ actually \gled uses its own
\texttt{pthread} wrapper classes)

\bigskip
\textbf{A most complete set of data-analysis \& scientific
  visualization elements}\nl
histograms for displaying server monitoring statistcs (could be
trees)\nl
linear algebra package for 3D geometry

\bigskip
\textbf{Introspection \& user-interaction bindings ---
  \texttt{TClass}, \cint \&
  \rootcint}\nl
introspection \q$\to$\q streaming, on-line object interaction, dynamic
GUI\nl
start-up scripts; excellent as application configuration and start-up steering

But there is some pain w/\cint:\nl
interwoven w/\root as application framework (streaming, GUI)\nl
fault tolerance could be better (nothing critical, but affects \root
as application)\nl
thread safety\nl
impossible to prevent object-access to the user (locking, remote
method execution)

% Gled preface ... the base class ZGlass

\textbf{\LARGE \gled as a \texttt{C++} framework/toolkit w/strong {\root}s} 

\bigskip
\textbf{Any OO framework/toolkit is all about objects and classes,}
but in particular:
\hfill{{\color{dgreen} \large GUI, visualization}\qq}
\nl
%
A) What you can do w/them? [data access, method execution, object
structuring, alternative representations]\nl
%
B) What they can do for you? [application functionality]

\bigskip
\textbf{\eg \root:}\qq \texttt{TObject} class offers serialization and introspection
methods\nl
coupled w/\root as an application you get: interactive access, object
browsing/GUI, \texttt{Draw()} into \texttt{TPad}

\bl

\textbf{Base-class for fully enabled \gled objects:} \qq \texttt{class ZGlass :
public TObject \dots}
\begin{enumerate}
  
\item method call serialization \& execution: \qq\qq {\color{dblue}\texttt{MIR --
    Method Invocation Request}}\nl
%
  \texttt{class ZMIR : public TMessage \q \dots} \hfill includes routing \&
  caller information, possibly a result request\nl
%
  execution of MIRs carried out by {\color{dblue}\emph{lenses}}
  themselves;\hfill in \gled as appl.\ steered and aided by other services
  
\item automatic generation of remote-execution methods, the per-class
  \texttt{MIR} execution code and \texttt{Get/Set} methods\nl
%
  \eg \texttt{void ClassX::DoSomething(args)} $\to$ \texttt{ZMIR*
    ClassX::{\color{red}S\_}DoSomething(args)} \nl
%
  accepts also \texttt{TObject}s as arguments and can hold arbitrary `data
  tail' (can be used for data transfer!)\nl
%
  the \texttt{Set} methods also have \texttt{S\_Set} counterparts \q
  $\to$ \q natural means for object-data synchronization

\item object aggregation methods (called links and lists) \hfill %
  must survive in a distributed environment!
  
\item reference counting w/ optional reverse-referencing

\item locking with granularity on per-object level \hfill (this is perhaps
  too strong)

\end{enumerate}
Glasses much more heavyweight: \smalltt{\color{dred}sizeof(TObject)=12,
  sizeof(ZGlass)=128; \qq sizeof(TNamed)=28.}
