README - Gled Build
===================

Gled is a framework for sharing object collections in a hierarchic
server-client model.

Gled is realeased under GNU GPL version 2. See LICENSE.

For building and installation instructions see INSTALL.

A brief description of files in this directory is in file MANIFEST.

This is a top-level Gled directory. It serves as a container for
libsets (in principle large compilation units) and provides:

 a) a compilation environment (in terms of parsers and code generators)

 b) run-time environment (by installing libraries, binaries or
    perl-scripts from local libsets into appropriate locations).

Libset names are typically capitalized as "This" or GledCore or Geom1.
The actual implementation of core Gled system is in the GledCore libset,
which contains two executables:
 * gled    standard executable with gui,
 * saturn  command interface only; useful for pure servers and proxies.


Preparing the environment
-------------------------

If you have a full binary packet, then the script binenv.(c)sh should
do the job: '. binenv.sh' or 'source binenv.csh'.

It expects ROOT to be in external/root/ and all other external software
to reside in external/ (with inner directories bin/, lib/, man/ etc).

The scripts should give you a good idea of what needs to be set.


Building Gled
-------------

See INSTALL.


Running
-------

gled -h 		# display command-line options:

gled hello_gled.C	# trivial demo

You will get the main window (basically message output), GUI shell
(somewhat intuitive, see gui-docs for details) and a GL window.

To navigate in GL window (pupil) use left/middle mouse buttons. Control key
modifies behaviour and is *REALLY* usefull:
left-drag	   forward/backwards slide left/right
ctrl-left-drag	   slide up/down     slide left/right
mid-drag	   turn up/down	     turn left/right
ctrl-mid-drag	   turn down/up	     roll left/right (think pilot stick)
<Home> will return you to the origin.


To connect to an already running gled, use:

gled -r -m <host-to-connect-to> moon.C
