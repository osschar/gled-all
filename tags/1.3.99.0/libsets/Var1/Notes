There is an issue with Int_t/UInt_t triangle indices - Opcode uses
UInt_t, TringTvor Int_t. Need to see how hierarhical tringula will be
implemented.

At some point I changed all methods that call Opcode to take UInt_t
arguments for triangle indices. I like this less and less now.

Anyway, -1 and OPC_INVALID_ID are both 0xffffffff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Had another creepy idea - to use doubles everywhere - in TriMesh and
in Opcode. This requires more memory, but allows to run a large planet
on a single tringula! Memory could be regained completely by
quantizing the vertex and triangle normals into shorts. Anyway, could
start with making a type-defed Opcode and templating the TriMesh.
