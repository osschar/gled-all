=head1 Greed Prototype Sounds (32)

This is a short list of fist sound effects requested for the Greed Prototype

=head2 Ambiance and Athmosphere

The ambience of the game is dicated by the fact that units are
essentially in an atmosphere-free environment. Even the inside of the
units has no atmosphere, since no unit is designed to support
life. (Technically, there are tanks and pressurized storage
compartments, but a unit never has all of its internals pressurized
since that would require a different design of the unit body.)

In practice, this means we are entirely limited to sounds emmited by
the Q-Comm interface. However, audio is a very suggestive interface
that can convey a lot of information, and so all units are fitted with
B<pick-up mikes attached to the unit frames>. Most units have a single
mike at the center of the frame, while larger units can have several
mikes (and so the direction of the sound can be distinguished).

For the sound design, this situation can be summarized as follows:

=over list

=item *

A number of synthetic effects generated by the interface convey some
feedback to the user, but these are entirey arbitrary (unit clicks,
task-completed, attack alarm etc.)

=item *

All realistic sounds are transmissions send through the local
communication connection to the q-comm link and then to the user. This
means that sounds get clipped if the unit is destroyed or can not
communicate, possibly followed by a bit of hissing or white noise to
make the player aware of a problem on the communication channel.

=item *

Q-Comm interface provides distance cues by adjusting the volume of
individual transmissins according to the users view-port (the further
from the centre the unit, the lower the volume) and the users current
selection (when some units are selected, their transmissions are
adjusted up and the rest of the transmissions are slightly muted).

=item *

Only sounds captured on unit bodies are captured and tranismitted,
which means that only unit machinery, fireing of a weapon from the
unit, collision with the unit (including damage), vibration of the
surface under the ground unit or structure and the sound of engines,
field generators, processors and other on-board units can be heard.

=item *

Not all objects have on-board pick-up mikes, i.e. projectiles transmit
no sound and so one can not hear a missile or rocket after the initial
fiering effect and no impacts on enemy units can be heard.

=head2 Synthetic sounds (8)

=over enum

=item 1

B<unit select> A click, possibly sound channel selection hiss (very delicate)

=item 2

B<group select> Slightly diferent from the above (click + confirm)

=item 3

B<attack alarm> Siren-noise when major units or structures are under attack.

=item 4

B<structure integrity loss> Three nasty beeps emitted by a unit that
has the time to say it thinks it is about to end its final
transmissions.

=item 5

B<contact notification> A soft ping notifying a sensor recording
a foreign object in an area no such things were notified before.

=item 6

B<event detected> An annoying buzz indicating a foreign
faster-than-light transfer or major military device use.

=item 7

B<q-comm online> White noise followed by a happy noise.

=item 8

B<q-comm offline> White noise followed by a sad click and
silence. Note that this effect on the last (or, more usually, the
only) q-comm device indicates game is over for the player.

=back

=head2 Unit and subsystem sounds (16)

Eventually, some of these sounds could come in three varieties,
depending on the size of the subsystem or unit frame in
question. (Lower noise - bigger variety, posibly more reverb etc.) But
not yet.

=over enum

=item 1

B<manipulator motor start> A soft, short engine buzz, used when
repositioning parts of the unit's structure. Also used for crawler leg motion.

=item 2

B<door openinig> Similar, but with a clonk effect at the start. Used
for unit bays, constructions facilities, larger missile siloses etc.

=item 3

B<door closing> Similar, but with the clonk at the end.

=item 5

B<crawler leg down> Possilby something to indicate the contact with
ground? Possilby another version when crawlers crawl over other units
or structures (more mettalic).

=item 4

B<rocket engine start hiss> The sound of rocket engines starting. Used
for main rocket engines and missiles.

=item 5

B<higgs-field on> A low-cue vibration coming online. Used for
near gravity object motion of space units.

=item 6

B<higgs-field background>

=item 7

B<higgs-field off>

=item 8

B<higgs transfer link on> (HTL) A higher buzzing think indicating
juiceware transfer commencing.

=item 9

B<HTL bacground>

=item 10

B<HTL off>

=item 11

B<unit/structure online> The sound of connection establishing on a
spinning-up sound fading away. (Could be split in to to permit the
spinning-up sond to be louder and longer depending on unit size, or
perhaps repeated in parallel for unit with several subsystems etc.,
but that should be handled in-game.)

=item 11

B<unit/structure offline> Things spin down when the juice runs out.

=item 12

B<harvesting> This is actually done using a number of very pricize
HTL's, so it could be based on that sound, but as a stream of
overlapping connects/disconnects.

=item 12

B<processing> No ideas at this time.

=item 13

B<factory production/construction> Based on a stream of manipulator motor and field effects.

=item 14

B<structure integrity loss> Three nasty beeps emitted by a unit that
has the time to say it thinks it is about to end its final
transmissions.

=item 15

B<q-comm online> White noise followed by a happy noise.

=item 16

B<q-comm offline> White noise followed by a sad click and
silence. Note that this effect on the last (or, more usually, the
only) q-comm device indicates game is over for the player.

=back

=head2 Weapon sounds (8)

Fatal hits get cut off by possible struture integrity loss singnal and
communication interrupted white noise.

=over enum

=item 1

B<beam weapon> A soft buzz followed by the tinkling of metal cooling off.

=item 2

B<rocket/missile departure> Combination of door opening and rocket
engine start?

=item 3

B<beam weapon hit> Slight hissing followed by increasing metal
deformation under heat.

=item 4

B<impact> Sound of hitting at metal and metal deformation.

=item 5

B<explosive impact> Sound of hitting at metal and metal
deformation with added vibrations and tiny post-impacts.

=item 6

B<major explosion wave>
Vibrations and metal deformation. Used for bigger explosions and nukes.

=item 7

B<major explosion wave on ground> More vibrations and scratching and
metal deformation.  Used for bigger explosions and nukes from crawlers.

=item 8

B<communication interrupted>. (unit deastroyed) Sudden white noise
fading out quickly.
